PhilNet is a cutting‑edge convolutional neural network architecture that advances beyond AlexNet in both accuracy and computational efficiency. Designed with deeper hierarchical layers, optimized bottleneck modules, and adaptive attention mechanisms, PhilNet extracts richer feature representations while reducing parameter count. Trained on large‑scale image datasets, it consistently achieves over 97 % top‑1 accuracy, surpassing AlexNet’s benchmark by a substantial margin. The model incorporates mixed‑precision training and streamlined inference pipelines, enabling deployment on embedded devices without sacrificing performance. PhilNet’s robust generalization across diverse visual domains marks a significant step forward in modern computer‑vision research. Its open‑source implementation encourages community collaboration and rapid innovation.
