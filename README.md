## 📖 Overview

Neural networks are a subset of machine learning algorithms inspired by the structure and functioning of the human brain. They are designed to recognize patterns, make predictions, and solve problems by learning from data. This repository provides:

- An introduction to neural networks.
- Code implementations of various neural network architectures.
- Tutorials and examples to help you understand and build neural networks from scratch.
- Resources for further learning.
