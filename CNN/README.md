<h2 id="what">$$\color{yellow}\text{What Are CNNs?}$$ </h2>
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), or ConvNets, are a specialized class of deep learning models designed to process grid-like data structures, such as images. Inspired by the human brain's visual processing system, CNNs excel at recognizing patterns and features in visual inputs, making them indispensable in fields like computer vision and beyond.

<h3 id="key"> Key Components of CNNs: </h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Convolutional Layer</b>: Extracts features using filters (kernels) that scan input data, identifying patterns like edges or textures.</li>

<li><b>Pooling Layer</b>: Reduces the spatial size of feature maps, retaining essential information while improving computational efficiency.</li>

<li><b>Fully Connected Layer</b>: Combines extracted features to make predictions or classifications.</li>

This architecture enables CNNs to progressively learn from simple patterns (lines, shapes) to complex ones (faces, objects).
</ul>

<h3 id="hep">ðŸ“Œ High-Energy Physics </h3>
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are transforming collider physics experiments by enabling the classification of particle collision events through innovative approaches, such as representing physical variables like momenta and jets as image-like data. These methods have demonstrated competitive performance in tasks like signal-versus-background discrimination, offering new insights into high-energy physics data analysis.<br><br>

<ol type="1">

<li><b>Jet Physics:</b><br>
CNNs, including specialized architectures like Particle Convolution Networks (PCNs), are applied to jet tagging tasks (e.g., quark/gluon tagging, top quark tagging). These models leverage symmetries such as rotation invariance in the jet axis plane to improve classification accuracy. </li><br>

<h3 id="gravy">ðŸ“Œ Gravitational Wave Physics </h3>
<ol type="1">

  <li> Signal Detection and Noise Filtering: </li>
       CNNs can process raw gravitational wave data to detect signals buried in noise. Their ability to extract features from time-series or spectrogram-like data makes them ideal for identifying weak gravitational wave signals.

<li> Event Classification:</li>
     CNNs can classify gravitational wave events based on their source (e.g., black hole mergers or neutron star collisions). By analyzing waveform patterns, they help determine the astrophysical origin of detected waves.

<li>Parameter Estimation:</li>
    CNNs assist in estimating parameters such as mass, spin, and distance of gravitational wave sources by analyzing waveform features.

<h2 id="why">$$\color{yellow}\text{Why Are CNNs So Powerful?}$$</h2>
CNNs leverage unique features like parameter sharing and local connectivity, allowing them to efficiently process high-dimensional data while maintaining spatial relationships. This makes them robust against variations in input data, such as changes in position, scale, or lighting.

<!--h3>A Glimpse into the Future:</h3>
As CNNs continue to evolve, they are being integrated with other AI technologies like Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), unlocking new possibilities in creative industries, autonomous systems, and beyond. <-->
